Function calling with incorrect parameter types or number of parameters can lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors.  VBScript is dynamically typed, but it still performs type checking at runtime. Passing a string where a number is expected, for example, may cause a Type mismatch error.  Another common issue is neglecting to handle potential errors that could arise during function execution. This can cause a script to halt abruptly and potentially corrupt data.
